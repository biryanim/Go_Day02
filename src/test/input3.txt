People tell me what they think. They tell me that it is not good to make pictures. They tell me that it is better to study geography,
history, maths and grammar. After these words, I don’t want to make pictures.
I don’t want to make pictures because my picture number one and picture number two are not good for the people.
People don’t understand simple things. And now, I am not a child. I am a big person. I have a job. I am a pilot.
I fly planes. I fly in many countries. And it is true that geography is good for me. Geography can help me if I am lost in the night.
